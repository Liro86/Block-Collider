# Block-Collider
My first game in Unity, never finished

I made this game with Brackeys tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik&t=39s)

Later i tried out new things and added sound effects, implemented premade assets and textures and much more.

I use it as a project for experimenting and learning, so it may not work properly all the time.

Currently there is one Level but so far I'm the only one who managed to complete it so try your luck.
