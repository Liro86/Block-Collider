# Block-Collider
My first game in Unity, never finished

I made this game with Brackeys tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik&t=39s).

Later i tried out new things and added sound effects, implemented premade assets and textures and much more.

I use it as a project for experimenting and learning, so it may not work properly all the time.

Currently there is only one Level but it's pretty tough so try your luck.
